<p>A good research question connects theory to hypothesis, where a hypothesis is a specific statement about what we expect to observe in the world.</p>

<h3>Theory</h3>
<p>A theory is a well-supported explanation for why something happens, based on evidence and observations. It is not merely a hunch, guess, or speculation. A good theory explains the cause behind an observed event and has predictive powerâ€”meaning it can help predict what may happen in similar situations.</p>

<h3>Hypothesis</h3>
<p>A hypothesis is a proposed explanation or prediction about an event or situation, typically based on existing knowledge or facts. It should be testable through research or experimentation and clearly state the relationships between variables.</p>

<h3>Research Question</h3>
<p>A good research question connects a theory to a hypothesis and helps advance our understanding of the theory. It must be answerable and serves as a tool for determining whether a theory is valid.</p>

<h3>The Importance of Proper Research Design</h3>
<p>Research needs to be properly designed to avoid inconsistent results when addressing a research question. Without a well-structured design, the results may be unreliable and unhelpful.</p>

<h3>Principles of Research Design</h3>
<ul>
    <li>How to build an answerable research question.</li>
    <li>Determining which quantitative empirical research to perform in order to answer the research question.</li>
    <li>Identifying what needs to be measured.</li>
    <li>Ensuring that your chosen method actually answers the research question.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Causality</h3>
<p>Causal diagrams represent the data-generating process that led to the data. To create these diagrams, we must understand as much as possible about the data-generating process. This requires conducting thorough research on the topic at hand.</p>
