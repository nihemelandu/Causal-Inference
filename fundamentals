A good research question takes us from theory to hypothesis, where a hypothesis is a specific statement about what we will observe in the world.
Theory: is a well-supported explanation for why something happens, based on evidence and observations and is not just a hunch, a guess or speculation. It explains the cause behind an observed event. A good theory has predictive power to predict what may happen in a similar situition.
Hypothesis: is a proposed explanation or prediction about an event or situition typically based on existing knowledge or facts. It should be possible to test it through research or experimentatiin.It should clearly state relationships beteen variables.
Research Question: A good research question connects a theory to a hypothesis. It helps advance our understanding of a theory. It must be answerable. A research question help determine if a theory is any good.

<p>It is important for research to be properly designed. Why? Gives inconsistent result to a research question if not properly designed.</p>

<strong>Principles of Research Design</strong><br>

<ul>
<li>Ways to build an answerable research question.</li>
<li>Determine the quantitative empirical research to perform to answer the research question.</li>
<li>What would you need to measure?</li>
<li>How to determine that your method actually answer your question?</li>
<ul>

Causality
<p>Causal diagrams represents the data generating process that got us our data. To accomplish this, we must know as much as possible about the generating process. The first step is to conduct rigorous research on our topic.</p>
